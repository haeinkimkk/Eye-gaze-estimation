# Eye-gaze-estimation
This is an eye-gaze-estimation algorithm that implemented by Pytorch. The project also uses the additive angular margin loss that proposed in the paper ["Face: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698), which acquires higher accuracy than that use Softmax Loss.
